*
* Ver   Who  Date     Changes
* ----- ---- -------- -----------------------------------------------
* 1.00a rpm  01/09/02 First release
* 1.00b jhl  02/21/02 Repartitioned the driver for smaller files
* 1.00b jhl  04/24/02 Compressed the ack table into a bit mask.
* 1.00c rpm  10/17/03 New release. Support the static vector table created
*                     in the xintc_g.c configuration table.
* 1.10c mta  03/21/07 Updated to new coding style

*
* This configuration table contains entries that are modified at runtime
* by the driver. The EDK tools populate the table with default values for the
* vector table and the options flag. These default values can be, and are,
* overwritten at runtime by the driver.  This is a deviation from most drivers'
* configuration tables in that most are created statically by the tools and
* are never modified during runtime.  Most tables reflect only the hardware
* configuration of the device. This Intc configuration table contains software
* information in addition to hardware configuration.  The Intc configuration
* table should be considered an exception to the usage of the configuration
* table rather than the norm.

 * This table contains configuration information for each intc device

 * Generally, acknowledge before service is used when the interrupt signal is
